# numpad-macros
An AHK script I wrote to make use of the Number Pad of the laptop and some other keys while keeping its default functionality intact.

Info:

 This script is written to work on the exact device(Acer Nitro 5 2018). So key mapping and the behavior might be differ from device to device.

 Most of the application launches are mapped to the taskbar order so either your device will need to be prepared or the script will need adaptations.
